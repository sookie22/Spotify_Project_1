Analyse a dataset of your choice

## Executive Summary

Our research presents a comprehensive analysis on Spotify’s top 50 songs across various countries where it sheds light on the underlying variables that contribute to songs popularity. We examine multiple factors such as genre, artists prevalence and regional preferences where significant trends emerge.


### Key Findings

What variables are more common in popular songs by country:
Analysing variables which correlate to popular songs revealed intriguing insights….


Top 10 songs that appear most frequently within selected counties:
Across the surveyed countries, we find that at the current time of the data set; Paint the Town Red by Doja Cat appears most frequent within the selected countries 175 times within the Top 50 playlists. Notable patterns in the song sheds light on cross-cultural musical preferences and its global hits. 


Count of Taylor Swift Songs across Selected Countries:
The prevalence of Taylor Swift’s songs within the top 50 playlists showcased varying degrees of popularity across different countries, indicative of her global appeal and localised fanbasing. The analysis found that countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Other diverse countries from other continents in our selection are not so popular.


Top 10 Artists within the Selected Countries:
The dominance in Taylor Swift frequently appearing songs alongside respective artists within the selected countries provide deeper insights into preferences and recurring musical trends. Taylor Swift's extreme popularity in her songs outperforms other artists on the top 50 playlists. She appears 1200+ times compared to the runner up Doja Cat who roughly appears 300 times. 


Predicting popular songs
This dataset included a number of variables to define music taste, namely: acousticness, danceability and instrumentalness. These variables were plotted against popularity in the aim to identify if any one variable strongly correlated with popularity. Unfortunately not strong correlations were identified and it was postulated that this may be a result of the positively skewed nature of the data. Given that the data set represents the top 50 songs in every country, only the most popular songs are included with a median popularity of 80. Correlations might have been better discerned if a more normally distributed dataset was selected. In brief, danceability had a very low (r=0.074) negative correlation with popularity, acousticness had a very low (r=0.118) positive correlation with popularity and instrumentalness had a very low (r=0.109) negative correlation with popularity.


### Popularity and use of explicit language

The frequency of explicit songs in the top 50 globally was graphed in a bar chart. This illustrated that non-explicit songs were almost twice as likely to appear in the top 50 globally. From representing frequency of explicit/non-explicit songs in the top 50 by country, it is evident that different countries have different preferences in this regard. For example Japan and Korea had very low tolerance for explicit songs, whilst explicit/non-explicit songs were almost equally as represented in the top 50 of countries such as USA, and Nigeria.


### Implications and Further Analysis

Understanding variables that drive song popularity significantly influence playlist curation for both emerging and well established artists. The analysis finds that there is a significance of variables which allows for a song/artist to be popular. Further analysis, especially on the correlation between the variables could enhance the understanding of musical preferences in diverse cultural contexts.

### Conclusion:

Local and Regional Resonance: The varying appearance counts of Taylor Swift across countries suggest that local and regional artists hold significant sway. While Taylor Swift resonates strongly in English-speaking countries, the lower counts in non-English-speaking countries highlight the influence of local or regional artists and cultural preferences. Similarly, different countries display different preferences when it comes to the popularity of songs with explicit language.
Global Impact of K-pop: The consistent presence of Korean singers, including Lim Young Woong, Jimin, and V, in the top 50 songs worldwide underscores the global dominance of K-pop. This trend demonstrates that K-pop transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries, appealing to diverse audiences.
Strength of Local Connections: Ayliva's success, primarily singing in German, highlights the importance of a strong connection to local language and culture. This indicates that artists who maintain a local focus can resonate strongly with audiences in their home regions.

### Limitations
Sampling data: Only two countries per continent were analyzed, so the findings might not cover all global music tastes. Some countries' preferences might be missing.
Country population size: Countries with smaller populations might have fewer appearances, not because they dislike certain songs but simply due to their smaller size. This could affect the results.
Top 50 Focus: Looking only at the top 50 songs might leave out less popular but still significant artists or music styles in some regions.
Trends Change Quickly: The data is updated daily, catching short-term trends, but it might miss longer-term shifts in what people like. Music preferences can change fast.
